<h1>NLCrypt: Semantic Cryptography</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
NLCrypt is an attempt to create a cryptography system that doesn't
look like a cryptography. It disguises a secret message as a
grammatical (but nonsensical) text by changing its meanings. It can be
used for a casual use to slip a secret message into web forums or
emails. NLCrypt currently supports English text only.
<p>
<strong>Warning:</strong>
This is just a proof-of-concept implementation. The encryption algorithm is not
analyzed therefore neither its security nor reliability is guaranteed.
Do not use this for serious purposes.

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>
NLCrypt is basically a combination of a dictionary cipher and a Caesar
method.  It takes each word in a message (except stop words) and
shifts it in a dictionary.
<p>
Here's an example:
<p>
In a message "<code>He likes coffee.</code>", 
the words "<code>likes</code>" and "<code>coffee</code>" are
tagged as <code>VBZ+NNS</code> and <code>NN</code> respectively.
This means that "<code>likes</code>" can be either a present tense verb 
(<code>VBZ</code>) or a plural noun (<code>NNS</code>), while "<code>coffee</code>" 
always takes a singular form (<code>NN</code>) because it is a mass noun.
<p>
Now, there are several other words that are tagged as <code>VBZ+NNS</code>.
Such words include: <code>adds</code>, <code>backs</code>, 
<code>calls</code>, <code>changes</code>, ... etc.
"<code>likes</code>" is the 22nd word in this group.  This is replaced
with another word in the group such as "<code><em>forms</em></code>".
Note that changing "<code>likes</code>" to
"<code><em>forms</em></code>" doesn't change the sentence's
grammatical structure, because both can take a present tense verb or a
plural noun (<code>VBZ+NNS</code>).
<p>
Similarly, "<code>coffee</code>" is replaced with another word in
the <code>NN</code> group, such as "<code><em>heart</em></code>".
This way, the entire message is translated to
"<code><em>He forms heart.</em></code>", which is grammatically
equivalent to the original sentense but has a rather different meaning.
Using a certain cipher algorithm and a given key, 
the translation can be different which is hard to predict 
for outsiders.

<h3>Grouping with Word Frequency</h3>

<p>
Actual words are grouped not only by its part of speech, but also its
frequency. This has two purposes.  First, this prevents a popular word
from suddenly getting replaced with a rather uncommon word, because
its transition is limited to the similarly popular words. Secondly,
this prevents the frequency analysis because the rarity of each word
doesn't give a hint to attackers.
<p>
In the actual implementation, a group of words is named
using both its parts of speech and the frequency,
such as <code>VBZ+NNS:8</code>, which means
a word that can take either <code>VBZ</code> or <code>NNS</code> 
and has a frequency level 8. A frequency level is defined as 
the logarithm of the word frequency.

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<h3>Dictionary</h3>
<p>
WordNet is currently used.
<p>
Stop Words

<h3>Cipher</h3>

<p>
HMAC and RpC4

<h3>CBC Mode</h3>

<h2>Weaknesses</h2>
<p>
The algorithm is vulnerable to words which are not in a dictionary,
such as rare words, foreign words, proper nouns, numbers and URLs.  In
such cases a letter-to-letter encryption is used, which can be vulnerable
to a known plaintext attack.
